        <p><h3>Our Story</h3>
            Welcome to Plantsourcery Nursery! At our nursery we sell a <i>'plethora'</i>
             of plant types: <br>
             your everyday houseplant, herbal plants meant for tea, 
             and even rare exotics. <br> Our inventory contains PlantBabies that 
             can get you started in their respective categories. Our selection also makes great 
             additions to any PlantParents collection.<br><br>
             Plantsourcery Nursery was started by Dana Lopez in 2021. A lover of warm cups of tea,
              Dana initially decided to sell plants that caant be used for tea. Soon after her first 
              few weeks of sales at Plantsourcery Nursery, demand for other PlantBaby types was expressed by a 
              client (Instructor Dana Wyatt). Today, we (by 'we,' we mean I) take pride in our inventory selection
               of 1 houseplant, 2 plants that can be used for tea (and other beverages), and 2 rare exotics. <br>

            <h3>Shipping</h3>
            Here at Plantsourcery Nursery, we employ a small team. By 'we,' we mean 'me.' 
            Due to our size, shipping normally takes 3-5 business days. Occaisonally, shipping 
            times may take longer due to large quantity of orders. This normally occurs during
            holidays such as Mother'd Day, Valentine's Day, and Christmas. Please be aware that
             shipping times may also be delayed for tea plants during flu/and cold season; and 
             for all plants during the Spring seasons. If you are concerned about receiving your 
             order within a specific timeframe, please shell out the extra dollars for speedy 
             delivery of your plantbaby.
