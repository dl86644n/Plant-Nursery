            <h3>Shipping</h3>
            Here at Plantsourcery Nursery, we employ a small team. By 'we,' we mean 'me.' 
            Due to our size, shipping normally takes 3-5 business days. Occaisonally, shipping 
            times may take longer due to large quantity of orders. This normally occurs during
            holidays such as Mother'd Day, Valentine's Day, and Christmas. Please be aware that
             shipping times may also be delayed for tea plants during flu/and cold season; and 
             for all plants during the Spring seasons. If you are concerned about receiving your 
             order within a specific timeframe, please shell out the extra dollars for speedy 
             delivery of your plantbaby.
